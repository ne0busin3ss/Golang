Go development - learning via code topics for development. I'm following along in a book 'Head First Go' and working through each chapter. Additionally, I'm downloading Go code and stepping through code, to understand what each line does. I'm not very good at the moment but I'll continue to work and improve so I can write reasonably good Go code.
